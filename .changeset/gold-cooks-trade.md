**New Layout**

- Remove navbar from docs layout, replace it with sidebar.
- On smaller devices, navbar is always shown.
- Remove exports of internal components, copying components from the repository is now the preferred way.

**migrate:** On layouts, Rename `nav.githubUrl` to `githubUrl`. 
Modify your stylesheet if necessary.
