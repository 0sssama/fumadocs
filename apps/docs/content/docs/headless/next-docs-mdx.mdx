title: Next Docs MDX
description: The native content source for Next Docs

Please follow the [Getting Started Guide](/docs/mdx) to setup Next Docs MDX for
your documentation.

## Features

Currently it only supports local content (which most people use). It uses the
official Next.js MDX loader (you can pass your own loader), which allows you to
import images and CSS files directly in MDX files.

Technically should have a better performance than Contentlayer, since it doesn't
need to run esbuild separately to build MDX files. We can easily add properties
to vfile.data and export it via custom plugins
