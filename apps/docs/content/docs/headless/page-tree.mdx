description: The structure of page tree.
---

Page tree is a tree that includes all the pages, separator and folders.

It will be sent to the client and required for sidebar and breadcrumb. Hence,
you shouldn't store any sensitive or large data in page tree.

> **Note:** Unserializable data such as functions can't be passed to page tree.

## Conventions

Items can be either a separator, page or folder.

### Page

It contains a url and display name.

```json
{
  "type": "page",
  "name": "Quick Start",
  "url": "/docs"
}
```

### Folder

It contains a display name, a list of items and an optional index page

```json
{
    "type": "folder",
    "name": "Guide",
    "index": {
        "type": "page",
        ...
    }
    "children": [
        ...
    ]
}
```

### Separator

It only contains a display name.

```json
{
  "type": "separator",
  "name": "Components"
}
```

### Example

```js
export const tree = [
  {
    type: 'page',
    name: 'Quick Start',
    url: '/docs'
  },
  {
    type: 'separator',
    name: 'Guides'
  },
  {
    type: 'page',
    name: 'Example',
    url: '/docs/example'
  }
]
```

### Type Bindings

You can import the type from server package.

```ts
import type { TreeNode } from 'next-docs-zeta/server'

const tree: TreeNode[] = []
```
