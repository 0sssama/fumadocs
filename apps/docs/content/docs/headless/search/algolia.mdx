## Indexing

The default behavior creates a record for each paragraph in your document which
officially recommended by Algolia.

Each record contains searchable attributes `title`, `section`, and `content`.
`section` is optional, it only exists in paragraphs under headings. Headings and
paragraphs are all indexed as a record, and the attribute for distinct is
`page_id`.

## Setup

1. Install `algoliasearch`

   ```bash
   npm install algoliasearch
   ```

2. Sign up and obtain the required API keys for your search. Store these
   credentials in environment variables.

3. Create and sync your index with the `sync` function.

   ```js
   import algosearch from 'algoliasearch'
   import { sync } from 'next-docs-zeta/algolia/server'
   import { structure } from 'next-docs-zeta/mdx-plugins'

   const client = algosearch(...)

   sync(client, {
     documents: allDocs.map(docs => ({
       ...docs,
       url: getPageUrl(docs.slug),
       structured: structure(docs.body.raw)
     }))
   })
   ```

   You may make it a script and manually sync with `node ./update-index.mjs`, or
   integrate it with your CI/CD pipeline.

4. To search documents on the client side, you may use the search dialog
   provided by Next Docs UI, or implement your own for advanced styling.

   In addition, you can use the `useAlgoliaSearch` hook which handles loading
   states with SWR.

   ```ts
   import { useAlgoliaSearch } from 'next-docs-zeta/search-algolia/client'

   const index = algoliasearch(...).initIndex('document')

   const { search, setSearch, query } = useAlgoliaSearch(index, {
      distinct: 5,
      hitsPerPage: 10
   })
   ```

### Customise Attributes & Settings

While the default attributes might not suit your case, you can pass `extra_data`
to index options for adding extra fields to each record.

```js
sync(client, {
  documents: allDocs.map(docs => ({
    ...,
    extra_data: {
      tag: docs.tag
    }
  }))
})
```

To customize the default index settings, set index settings, and update
documents with `updateDocuments(...)` separately.

> Notice that it expects the `url` property of a page to be a unique value and
> won't duplicated. In other words, you shouldn't have two pages with the same
> url.
