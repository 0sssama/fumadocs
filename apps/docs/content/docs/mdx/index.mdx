## Introduction

Next Docs MDX is a Next.js plugin that enhances the experience of the official
`next/mdx` package. It parses frontmatter and is bundled with several MDX
plugins for building a good documentation site.

> This package must be used with `next-docs-zeta`

## Usage

### Install Dependencies

Notice that the package doesn't include loader by default.

```package-install
next-docs-mdx @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react @types/mdx
```

### Configuration

Add this to your `next.config.mjs` file:

```js
import createNextDocsMDX from 'next-docs-mdx/config'

const withFumaMDX = createNextDocsMDX()

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const config = {
  reactStrictMode: true
}

export default withFumaMDX(config)
```

<Callout title="Be Careful" type='warn' className="mt-4">

The Next.js config must be a `.mjs` file since it requires ESM-only modules.

</Callout>

### Define MDX Components

Create `mdx-components.tsx` in your root directory.

```tsx
import type { MDXComponents } from 'mdx/types'
// Assume you're using Next Docs UI
import defaultComponents from 'next-docs-ui/mdx-server'

export function useMDXComponents(components: MDXComponents): MDXComponents {
  return {
    ...defaultComponents,
    ...components
  }
}
```

### Build Page Tree

Create a `source.ts` file to build the page tree. Read
[Pages Conventions](/docs/headless/utils/build-page-tree#pages-structure) to
learn how to structure your pages.

```ts title="source.ts"
import { map } from '@/_map'
import { fromMap } from 'next-docs-mdx/map'

export const { getPage, getPageUrl, pages, tree } = fromMap(map)
```

> The `@/_map` file will be generated automatically

### Start Server

Start the dev server

```bash
next dev
```

A `_map.ts` file should be created. You can log and see if page tree is built
correctly.

## Built-in Features

A Table of Contents (`toc`) and Structurized Data (`structuredData`) is parsed
and exported from MDX files by default, you can use these for implementing a
search or TOC section in your docs.

## Advanced Usages

### MDX Plugins

You can customise the options passed to `@next/mdx`.

```js
const withNextDocs = createNextDocs({
  mdxOptions: {
    remarkPlugins: [remarkMath],
    rehypePlugins: [rehypeKatex]
  }
})
```

### Export Properties from `vfile.data`

A remark plugin that turns `vfile.data` properties into exports is applied by
default, you can pass the property names via `dataExports`.

```js
const withNextDocs = createNextDocs({
  dataExports: ['data']
})
```
