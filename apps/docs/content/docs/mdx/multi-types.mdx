description: Support multiple type of documents in your Next.js app

You can have multiple document types, such as a blog post, or a document. By
passing the `rootDir` option, the resolved files will be restricted within a
specified folder.

## Usage

Set a root directory, notice that this will make all resolved files relative to the directory.

```ts
const blog = fromMap(map, {
  rootDir: 'mdx',
  baseUrl: '/docs/mdx',
});
```

### Custom Slugs

You may override the `getSlugs` property to customise the way it generates slugs.

```ts
const blog = fromMap(map, {
  rootDir: 'mdx',
  baseUrl: '/docs/mdx',
  getSlugs: ...
});
```
