title: Multiple Types
description: Support multiple type of documents in your Next.js app
---

You can have multiple document types, such as a blog post, or a document. By
passing the `rootDir` option, the resolved files will be restricted within a
specified folder, and only use its own validate options.

## Usage

Set a root directory, along with a `slugs` function that generates slugs from
the file info.

The slugs function can read the `flattenedPath` property from file info, you may
split it to generate slugs based on its file path.

```ts
const blog = fromMap(map, {
  rootDir: 'mdx',
  baseUrl: '/docs/mdx',
  slugs,
  validate: {
    frontmatter: frontmatterSchema
  }
})
```
