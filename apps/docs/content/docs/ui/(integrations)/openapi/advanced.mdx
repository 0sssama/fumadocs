## How It Works?

Fumadocs OpenAPI has two parts:

### File Generator

It generates the MDX page with correct frontmatter, so you don't have to manually create a MDX file for each endpoint/operation.

### OpenAPI Server

It renders the API page, a server component.

The schema passed to server will also be fetched dynamically on server.

### Markdown

Markdown/MDX content is rendered in the server component (during runtime) using `@mdx-js/mdx`.

Your Remark/Rehype plugins (e.g. Rehype Code) configured in Fumadocs MDX or other source providers, will **not** be shared.
Fumadocs OpenAPI uses a separate MDX processor instance.

## Use API Page

To use the `APIPage` component in your MDX files directly:

```mdx
---
title: Delete Api
full: true
method: POST
route: /v1/apis.deleteApi
---

<APIPage
  operations={[{ path: '/v1/apis.deleteApi', method: 'post' }]}
  hasHead={false}
/>
```

| Prop         | Description                               |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `operations` | Operations (API endpoints) to be rendered |
| `hasHead`    | Enable to render the heading of operation |
