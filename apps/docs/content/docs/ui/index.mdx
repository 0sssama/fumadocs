title: Quick Start
description: Getting Started with Next Docs UI
---

Next Docs UI is the Next.js framework for building documentation website. Built
on the top of Next.js, Radix UI and Next Docs Zeta.

## Automatic Installation

Create a new app with `create-next-docs-app`.

```bash
npx create-next-docs-app
# or
pnpm create next-docs-app
# or
yarn create next-docs-app
```

## Manual Installation

Create a new Next.js application with `create-next-app`, and install required packages.

```package-install
next-docs-ui next-docs-zeta
```

### Configuration

Next Docs UI is unopinionated and doesn't provide content management features. You can choose a source
you prefer, such as [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev) and `next-docs-mdx`.

This is a list of sources supported by Next Docs:

- [Next Docs MDX](/docs/mdx)
- [Contentlayer](/docs/headless/contentlayer/config)

You have to configure the library correctly following their setup guide before continuing.

### Styles

You can import the pre-built stylesheet in the root layout.

```ts
import 'next-docs-ui/style.css';
```

For Tailwind CSS projects, you may use [the official plugin](/docs/ui/theme) instead.

> It doesn't come with a default font, you may choose one from `next/font`.

### Root Layout

Wrap the entire application inside [Root Provider](/docs/ui/blocks/root-provider).

```tsx {8}
import { RootProvider } from 'next-docs-ui/provider';
import type { ReactNode } from 'react';

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <RootProvider>{children}</RootProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### Layout

Create a new catch-all route for our docs, and give it a proper layout.

```tsx title="app/docs/[[...slug]]/layout.tsx"
import { DocsLayout } from 'next-docs-ui/layout';
import type { ReactNode } from 'react';

export default function RootDocsLayout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <DocsLayout tree={tree} nav={{ title: 'My App' }}>
      {children}
    </DocsLayout>
  );
}
```

> `tree` refers to [Page Tree](/docs/headless/page-tree), which should be provided by your data source.

### Page

For the `page.tsx`, it may vary depending on your source. You should manually configure static rendering with `generateStaticParams` and metadata with `generateMetadata`.

Make sure to wrap your content in the [Page](/docs/ui/blocks/page) component, this will also configure typography styles.

### Search

By default, it uses the built-in document search based on Flexsearch. [Learn to configure Document Search](/docs/headless/search/flexsearch) for your data source.

## Enjoy!

Now, Create your first mdx file in the docs folder.

```mdx title="content/docs/index.mdx"
---
title: Hello World
---

## Yo what's up
```

Run the app in development mode and see http://localhost:3000/docs.

```bash
npm run dev
```

### FAQ

<Accordions>
<Accordion id='collapsible-fix-error' title="How to fix 'supports-color' error?">

If you got this error:

```
Module not found: Can't resolve 'supports-color' in '.../node_modules/debug/src'
```

Try installing `supports-color@8.1.1`.

<Accordion title="Why Next Docs UI?">

Next Docs UI provides many built-in components, and is more flexible compared to
other existing frameworks.

And most importantly, it is compatible with Next.js App Router which results in
a faster page load speed with ~120kb initial Javascript load. You can easily use
Next Docs in an existing Next.js project, without refactoring anything.

Feel free to open the demo in CodeSandbox and see if it suits you.
