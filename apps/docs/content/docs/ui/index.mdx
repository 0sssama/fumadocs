## Introduction

**Fumadocs** can be broken down into two parts: Core and UI.

Core handles most of the logic, from search functionality, MDX enhancement, to content source APIs for you to plug in your own **content source**.

Fumadocs UI, as named, it is the official user interface for Fumadocs.

In this documentation, when we are calling Fumadocs UI, it refers to the entire framework.

> Fumadocs Core can be used without Fumadocs UI, in other words, it's headless.

## Automatic Installation

Create a new app with `create-fumadocs-app`.

<InstallTabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
    <Tab value='npm'>

```bash
npx create-fumadocs-app
```

    </Tab>
    <Tab value="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm create fumadocs-app
```

    </Tab>
    <Tab value='yarn'>

```bash
yarn create fumadocs-app
```

    </Tab>
    <Tab value='bun'>

```bash
bun create fumadocs-app
```

    </Tab>

</InstallTabs>

## Manual Installation

Create a new Next.js application with `create-next-app`, and install required packages.

```package-install
fumadocs-ui fumadocs-core
```

### Configuration

You can choose a **content source** you prefer, such as ContentLayer and Fumadocs MDX.

There is a list of supported sources:

- [Setup Fumadocs MDX](/docs/mdx)
- [Setup Contentlayer](/docs/headless/contentlayer)

You have to configure the library correctly following their setup guide before continuing.

### Styles

You can import the pre-built stylesheet in the root layout.

```ts
import 'fumadocs-ui/style.css';
```

For Tailwind CSS projects, use [the official plugin](/docs/ui/theme) instead.

> It doesn't come with a default font, you may choose one from `next/font`.

### Root Layout

Wrap the entire application inside [Root Provider](/docs/ui/blocks/root-provider).

```tsx
import { RootProvider } from 'fumadocs-ui/provider';
import type { ReactNode } from 'react';

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <RootProvider>{children}</RootProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### Layout

Create a new catch-all route `/app/docs/[[..slugs]]` for our docs, and give it a proper layout.

```tsx title="app/docs/layout.tsx"
import { DocsLayout } from 'fumadocs-ui/layout';
import { pageTree } from '@/source';
import type { ReactNode } from 'react';

export default function RootDocsLayout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <DocsLayout tree={pageTree} nav={{ title: 'My App' }}>
      {children}
    </DocsLayout>
  );
}
```

> `pageTree` refers to [Page Tree](/docs/headless/page-tree), it is needed for navigation components, which should be provided by your content source.

### Page

For the `page.tsx`, it may vary depending on your source. You should configure static rendering with `generateStaticParams` and metadata with `generateMetadata`.

Make sure to wrap your content in the [Page](/docs/ui/blocks/page) component, this will also configure typography styles.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Example with Fumadocs MDX">

```json doc-gen:file
{
  "file": "../../examples/next-mdx/app/docs/[[...slug]]/page.tsx",
  "codeblock": {
    "meta": "title=\"app/docs/[[...slug]]/page.tsx\""
  }
}
```

</Accordion>
</Accordions>

### Search

Use the default document search based on Flexsearch. [Learn to configure Document Search](/docs/headless/search/flexsearch) for your content source.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Example with Fumadocs MDX">

```json doc-gen:file
{
  "file": "../../examples/next-mdx/app/api/search/route.ts",
  "codeblock": {
    "meta": "title=\"app/api/search/route.ts\""
  }
}
```

</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Enjoy!

Now, Create your first mdx file in the docs folder.

```mdx title="content/docs/index.mdx"
---
title: Hello World
---

## Yo what's up
```

Run the app in development mode and see http://localhost:3000/docs.

```bash
npm run dev
```

### FAQ

<Accordions>
    <Accordion id='why-fumadocs-ui' title="Why Fumadocs UI?">

        Feel free to open the demo in CodeSandbox and see if it suits you.

        - Many built-in components
        - Integrations with Typescript Twoslash, OpenAPI, Math
        - Flexible and Fast by default
        - Built on App Router
        - Use Fumadocs in an existing Next.js project, without refactoring anything.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion id='fix-supports-color' title="How to fix 'supports-color' error?">

        If you got this error:

        ```
        Module not found: Can't resolve 'supports-color' in '.../node_modules/debug/src'
        ```

        This error sometimes appear when you are using ContentLayer, usually installing `supports-color@8.1.1` can fix the problem.

    </Accordion>
    <Accordion id='fix-dot-map-error' title="How to fix '@/.map' error?">

        If you are using Fumadocs MDX, the `.map.ts` file will be generated automatically once you start the dev server.

        For more information, see [Setup Guide](/docs/mdx).

    </Accordion>
    <Accordion id='dynamic-route' title="It uses Dynamic Route, will it be poor in performance?">

        Next.js turns dynamic route into static routes when `generateStaticParams` is configured.
        Hence, it is as fast as static pages.

    </Accordion>
    <Accordion id='blog-usage' title="Can I use it for Blog?">

        The answer is yes.

        Fumadocs is built for documentation sites, yet, it is very flexible.
        You can re-use the typography styles and leverage its built-in remark/rehype plugins.
        Check our [blog](/blog), it is also built with Fumadocs.

## Terminology

For a better understanding of the docs, there are some common terminologies you should know:

**Content Source:** The source of your content, for example, Fumadocs MDX, MDXTS and ContentLayer are examples of content source.
