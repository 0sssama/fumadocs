## The Standard

Fumadocs provides many useful extensions to MDX, a markup language. Here is a brief introduction to the default MDX syntax of Fumadocs.

> Fumadocs is source agnostic, you can use it with Fumadocs MDX, Contentlayer, or even a CMS.
> Markdown and MDX are not the only supported format of Fumadocs, in fact, you can use any renderers such as `next-mdx-remote`.

### MDX

MDX is a superset of Markdown, with support of JSX syntax.
It allows you to import components, and use them right in the document, or even export values.

```mdx
import { Component } from "./component";

<Component name="Hello" />
```

see [MDX Syntax](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/#mdx-syntax) to learn more.

### GitHub Flavored Markdown

A superset of Markdown (CommonMark syntax).

#### Tables

```mdx
| Table | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Hello | World       |
```

| Table | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Hello | World       |

#### Auto Links

```mdx
[My Link](https://github.github.com/gfm)

This also works: https://github.github.com/gfm.
```

See [GFM Specification](https://github.github.com/gfm).

### Heading Anchors

An anchor is automatically applied to all headings, it sanitizes invalid characters like spaces. (e.g. `Hello World` to `hello-world`)

#### Custom Anchor

You can add `[#slug]` to customise heading anchors.

```mdx
# heading [#my-heading-id]
```

To link people to a specific heading, add the heading id to hash fragment: `/page#my-heading-id`.

### Frontmatter

We support YAML frontmatter. It is a way to specify common information of the document (e.g. title).
Place it at the top of document.

```mdx
---
title: Hello World
---

## Title
```

### Codeblock

Syntax Highlighting is done with [Rehype Code](/docs/headless/mdx/rehype-code) automatically.

````mdx
```js
console.log('Hello World');
```
````

You can add a title to the codeblock.

````mdx
```js title="My Title"
console.log('Hello World');
```
````

### Images

All built-in content sources handle images properly.
Images are automatically optimized for `next/image`.

```mdx
![Image](/image.png)
```

### Twoslash CodeBlock

Write Typescript codeblocks with hover type information and detected types errors.

Not enabled by default. See [Twoslash](/docs/ui/twoslash).

### Math Equations

Not enabled by default. See [Math Integration](/docs/ui/math).

### More

Fumadocs also has optional plugins, you can see [a list of plugins](/docs/headless/mdx) supported by Fumadocs.
